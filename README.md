# Library-System-Management
It is a command line python program.
It is a "Library Management System‚Äù. For this, I have to created a library class which includes the following methods:

Displaybook() : To display the available books
Lendbook(): To lend a book to a user
Addbook(): To add a book in the library
Returnbook(): To return the book in the library.

As I have created a library class, now we will create an object and pass the following parameters in the constructor.

Australia=Library(listofbooks, "Australia Comic Books")

After that, I created a main function and run in an infinite while loop in which it asks the users for their input that whether they want to display, lend, add or return a book.

It maintains a dictionary for the users who own a book. Dictionary takes book name as a key and name of the person as a value. Whenever we lend a book to a user, It maintains a dictionary.
